## How to start

Head over to the [latest version](Versions/Taikov31.lua) and set it as current directory (`cd PATH_TO_Versions`). Now, type  
`raylua_s.exe Taikov31.lua`  
and enjoy!

## How does this work

This simulator uses raylib to implement the rendering and input. It parses .tja files, which are files that can store various / complicated charts.
