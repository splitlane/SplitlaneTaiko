- If you are using OpenTaiko on video sharing sites, live streaming services, websites, or blogs, please make sure you explicitly mention it is not Bandai Namco Entertainment official's software, and make sure it is not confused with other Taiko simulators.
- Also, if there is an tag feature on the website you are using, tagging it as "OpenTaiko", "TJAPlayer3-Develop-BSQ", or "TJAP3-BSQ" will avoid confusion with other simulators, and might raise video as similar content, so it is highly recommended.

## How to start

TODO: Make Batch file so easy
Head over to the [latest version](Versions/Taikov31.lua) and set it as current directory (`cd PATH_TO_Versions`). Now, type  
`raylua_s.exe Taikov31.lua`  
and enjoy!

## How does this work

Simply put: This simulator uses raylib to implement the rendering and input. It parses .tja files, which are files that can store various / complicated charts.

## WARNING: Code Quality

The code for `Taiko.ParseTJA` is pretty clean and well documented, and it has descriptions of every tja command from taiko-web tja-format wiki.  
On the other hand, the code for `Taiko.PlaySong` is optimized and not documented at all. It is filled with commented out code and uses some dirty optimizations.

## Using this

If you want to parse tja files efficiently and get a table of metadata and notes, use `Taiko.ParseTJA`.  
If you want to play the parsed tja data, use `Taiko.PlaySong`.

## Efficiency
