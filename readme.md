## How to start

Head over to the [latest version](Versions/Taikov26.lua) and set it as current directory. Now, type  
`luajit Taikov26.lua`  
and enjoy!

## How does this work

This simulator uses luajit ffi (foreign function interchange) bindings (pdcurses) and (raylib? soon) to implement the input. It parses .tja files, which are files that can store various / complicated charts.
